class PoincareCollection:
    """Container class for a collection of surfaces of section and related data, used for pickling

    This class is essentially a dictionnary of the elements making up a PoincarÃ© Map collection, that
    are required by the Tomography class. It is used only for convenience when saving (pickling)
    calculated data for reuse.

    Parameters
    ----------
    E_list: list or array
        Array of energy values corresponding to the energies of each set of orbits
    orbits_list: list
        List of shape (N_energies,N_orbits) where each element is again a list corresponding to
        a set of orbits at a given energy. An orbit is an array of shape (2,N) with the first
        axis giving x/y and N the number of points in the orbit.
    sections_list: list
        Same idea as for the orbits, except that a surface of section is an array of shape
        (2,nb_points) with nb_points the number of points in the Poincare map per orbit
        (number of crossings of the x/y plane)
    potential: Potential
        Potential that generated the collection (used if the collection is imported
        and exported)

        E_list
    orbitslist: list
        orbits_list
    sectionslist: list
        sections_list
    nb_energies: int
        Number of energy levels in the collection (= len(energylist))
    nb_orbits_per_E: int
        Number of orbits per energy
    
    (The total number of orbits in a collection is nb_energies x nb_orbits_per_E)
