- Stop integration ater n crossings
---> need to rewrite own version of solve_ivp that handles events differently
---> can copy some parts and discard the ones not needed ?
---> maybe implement chvar method of Pfenniger to calculate crossing point as precisely as possible
x Show orbit by clicking on poincar√© line DONE
- Test jacobian computation method & begin periodic orbit finder method

- Find a more elegant solution for t_eval: one for the nb_crossings mode and one for the other
