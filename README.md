# PoincarePy - Visualize Poincaré Maps interactively
PoincarePy is a Python module to compute Poincaré maps of 2D potentials and explore them interactively. The user can define a physical system by
using and combining a set of predefined potentials, or by implementing new ones themself, which is made very simple.
