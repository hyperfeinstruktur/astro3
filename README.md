# PoincarePy - Visualize Poincaré Maps interactively
PoincarePy is a Python module to compute Poincaré maps of 2D potentials and explore them interactively. The user can define a physical system by
using and combining a set of predefined potentials, or by implementing new ones themself, which is made very simple.

How to use
----------------------
The typical workflow is:
1. Create a potential. This can be one of the predefined potentials or a new custom one, as well as combinations of the latter. For a choice of parameters, it is useful to viszalize the resulting potential, e.g. in a notebook, in order to get an intuition about the allowed energies and the scales of the dynamical variables.
2. Choose an energy range to explore, and take note of the
